Array is an object which contains elements of similar data types 
and support access to them by index.

Java array is an object which contains elements of a similar data type.

Advantages
Code Optimization: It makes the code optimized, we can retrieve or sort the data efficiently.
Random access: We can get any data located at an index position.

Disadvantages
Size Limit: We can store only the fixed size of elements in the array. 
It doesn't grow its size at runtime. To solve this problem, 
collection framework is used in Java which grows automatically.
(Java array size is fixed.once array is created, you can't change the size of an array.)
