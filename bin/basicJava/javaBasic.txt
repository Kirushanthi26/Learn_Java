compiler -> java code to byte code
 
JDK => JRE + JVM + All tools (necessary for java programming)

JRE => JVM + Java Binaries and classes which are needed to execute program 

JVM => responsible for converting byte code to machine specific code (platform independence)

JDK > JRE > JVM 

-------------------------------
Install JDK on your local env
Link to download JDK https://jdk.java.net


Configure Environment Variables


Perform command ‘java -version’ and ‘javac -version’. 
You should see result in console. Java version should be the same as Javac version.

-----------------------------------------------------

console is an application to work with data input, output, and error in command line with out 
GUI for education purposes. 

.java file => This is exactly files where programming code written in Java will be stored.
After that will ask Java Compiler to compile source code to bytecode.
.class file => byte code 
JVM => machine code 

-------------------------
Class => start with capital letter 
method => start with lower 
constant => all upper case 

----------------------
