variable - we can store information in our programs to be able to work with it in the future.

data type are important to manage a memory size. 
each data type have fixed memory allocation. 
prevent from memory waste 

data type -> primitive types and reference types

reference types - classes, annotations, interfaces, enumerations, arrays.

primitive types - integers, floating point numbers, booleans, characters.

What is the difference between primitive and reference types?
the main difference is that primitive variables store the actual values, whereas reference variables
store the addresses of the objects they refer to. 

Making the primitive types into objects would have degraded performance too much.
primitive > reference

primitive wrap class is wrap That encapsulates all wrap's primitive data types 
so that this can be used to create objects.

byte, short, int, long 
float, double
boolean 
char 

------------------------------

java is a strongly typed language 
-every variable has a type 
-every expression has a type. 
-each type is strictly define 

----------------------
Variable is a piece of memory that can contain a data value.


The wrapper class in Java provides the mechanism to convert primitive into object 
and object into primitive.
autoboxing - primitives into objects
unboxing  - objects into primitives
