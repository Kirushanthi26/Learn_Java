Stack Memory contains primitive values that are specific to a method, so-called local variables, 
and the references to the objects that are in heap memory.

Java uses space for dynamic method allocation for Java objects and classes and the runtime.
Every time we are creating new objects, it's created in space.
But reference to this object is stored in Stack memory.
